**Ballroom dance will make you happier, smarter, and more beautiful. No joke**

Possibly the best preventative against Alzheimer's and Dementia. According to a 21 year study led by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City frequent dancing reduced the risk of dementia including Alzheimer's by 76%. Stanford University's Richard Powers summarizes [here][0] (and here is the [study for you diehards][1])

Do you like people? Or at least want people to like you? Ballroom can help you develop relationships. In ballroom everything you and your partner do has an immediate, real time affect upon each other. This offers quite a unique co-working opportunity. Overcoming the challenges will leave you with new abilities to both bond and work with people.

Develop a mastery over your body. Look and feel steadfast and confident within yourself.
