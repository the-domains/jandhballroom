**Private lessons**

...are the way most people learn to dance. You deserve to have your instructors undivided attention and having it will provide the best medium for dance instruction. We all move a bit different. Having personal time with your instructor means all instruction given is specifically for your movement.

**Your Wedding Dance**

...is your time to feel connected to the love of your life, and present yourselves as the best new couple ever. The difficulty is that it can be stressful feeling like you have no idea what you are doing. Let's set out a plan, wether you want a choreographed dance to your song or just a few moves to get you around the floor, we can help you own your dance floor.

**Special appearances**

We can provide a mixed set of services ranging from seminars and demonstrations, to courses and curriculum development. Want to know more? Call us!

**Dance Guidance**

It's crazy out there. Because we are independent, we can provide advice on what classes around the city would be especially helpful for you.

**We don't like to be tied down**

Though we spend a lot of our time in Mid-Town we're not exclusive to any studio. This means we can travel to a location for your convenience. Send us an email to discuss location.
